# Purpose

- Provide a cohesive design system for ListForge: buttons, forms, tables, modals, layout components, etc.
- Wrap ShadCN primitives with project-specific styling and defaults.
- Export a consistent, typed component API for the web app.

# Constraints

- No business logic / no direct API calls.
- Light local state for UI only (open/close state, input values).
- No Redux or RTK Query imports here.
- Keep components pure and reusable.

# Patterns

- Prefer composition over configuration-heavy components.
- Ensure all components are fully typed and ergonomic for the app.
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props.
- Export components from `src/index.ts` for easy importing.

# ShadCN Integration

- Wrap ShadCN UI primitives (from `@/components/ui/*`).
- Apply ListForge-specific theming and defaults.
- Maintain compatibility with ShadCN's component API where possible.
- Customize styling via Tailwind classes and CSS variables.

# Component Organization

- Organize by category: `ui/` (primitives), `blocks/` (composite components).
- Use Storybook stories for component documentation and testing.
- Keep component files focused: one component per file (or related components).

# Theming

- Support theme switching (light/dark mode) via theme provider.
- Use CSS variables for theme tokens.
- Export theme configuration and utilities.

# Accessibility

- Ensure components are accessible (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
- Follow WCAG guidelines.
- Test with screen readers when possible.

# Examples

- Primitives: `Button`, `Input`, `Dialog`, `Table`
- Blocks: `AppShell`, `DashboardShell`, `UserProfile`, `SettingsPanel`
