# Final Audit

You are performing the final audit pass on this change.

Goals:

- Confirm the approved plan is fully implemented end-to-end.
- Ensure the code is high quality, clear, and not over-engineered.
- Ensure everything follows this repo’s Cursor rules and design patterns.
- Ensure the repository builds successfully at the end.

Instructions:

- Use Cursor’s tools to inspect the plan, diffs, and all relevant files.
- Make small, safe fixes and simplifications where needed.
- Align any inconsistencies with the repo’s rules and patterns.
- Before you finish, run the project’s normal build command (for example, the one defined in package.json).
- If the build fails, fix the issues and re-run the build until it succeeds or you cannot make further progress.
- End by briefly summarizing what you checked, what you changed, and the final build status.
